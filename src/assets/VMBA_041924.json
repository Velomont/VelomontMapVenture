Our attention to the “little things”, our Sicilian heritage, our commitment to artisan pizza, and our creative Italian menu sets us apart as the area’s Restaurant of Choice. Like Pablo Picasso himself, we value ambience and vibe and deliver it through colors that soothe, flavors that move and music that grooves. As a family business, we value children, providing them with areas for play and peace. We provide a variety of ways to enjoy our hospitality including take out, dine in, delivery and dining al fresco. Our bar is a friend who always wants company, reserving the right to mix it up with live music or even trivia. Our produce and meats are from local farms and ranches, whenever possible.\n And, yes…we make GREAT pizza!"
